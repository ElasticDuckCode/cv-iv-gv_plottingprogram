To run this program:
	Install and use python3. NOT python2

This program requires the following packages:
	xlrd
	matplotlib
	numpy

You can install vanilla python3 (my preference) from the python official website, or install anaconda.



Will not plot if you extra error logging settings in your Keithley test. You can check your data and see if there are only 4 columns per frequency: CV, GV, VDC, F. If this is not the case, this program will not work with the data.

Currently this program works with 10kHz to 500kHz or greater data.
